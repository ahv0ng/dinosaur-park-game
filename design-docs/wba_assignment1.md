# Work Breakdown Agreement for Assignment 1 (cupOfJava)
Signed agreement is at the bottom of the page

## Design Rationale: Nick and Alden

- **Combined effort** over 2 calls
  - 1st call
    - **Objective:** To have established and documented (as described below) 
      shared understanding of overall system design
    - **Preperation:** Each member to individually think about how they would 
      implement the feature set and be ready to justify their thoughts. Ideally, 
      they have not been influenced by their partner’s ideas.
  - 2nd call
    - **Objective:** Review each other’s UML diagrams and make necessary 
      adjustments in preparation for submission.
    - **Preparation:** Each member to have completed their allocated 
      deliverables (see below for allocation).
- Done in Google Docs in shared Google Drive
  - For all classes (and their associated attributes and methods)
    - Why do they exist?
    - How do these relate to and interact with the system?
    - How does the implementation adhere to design principles?

## UML Class Diagrams: Alden

- LucidChart shared document
- Shared with Nick
- Nick will review

## UML Interaction Diagrams: Nick

- Creating a communication diagram to depict interaction between classes. Not a 
  sequence diagram as this will become too large and complicated to keep track.
- LucidChart shared document
- Shared with Alden
- Alden will review

# Deadlines

- 1st call on **Thursday 17th September**
- 2nd call on **Tuesday 22nd September**
- Ideally complete everything by **Wednesday 23rd September** to have time to 
  talk to tutors if necessary
